Google XML Sitemaps Generator for WordPress

Currently homepage, posts, static pages, categories, archives and author pages are supported.

The priority of a post depends on its comments. You can choose the way the priority
is calculated in the options screen.

Adding other pages to the sitemap via other plugins

This plugin uses the action system of WordPress to allow other plugins
to add urls to the sitemap. Simply add your function with add_action to
the list and the plugin will execute yours every time the sitemap is build.
Use the static method "GetInstance" to get the generator and AddUrl method
to add your content.

Sample:

function your_pages() {
	$generatorObject = &GoogleSitemapGenerator::GetInstance();
	if($generatorObject!=null) $generatorObject->AddUrl("http://blog.uri/tags/hello/",time(),"daily",0.5);
}
add_action("sm_buildmap", "your_pages");

Parameters:
- The URL to the page
- The last modified data, as a UNIX timestamp (optional)
- The Change Frequency (daily, hourly, weekly and so on) (optional)
- The priority 0.0 to 1.0 (optional)


Rebuilding the sitemap on request

If you want to rebuild the sitemap because dynamic content from your plugin has changed,
please use the "sm_rebuild" hook which is available since 3.1.9.
All other methods, like calling the Build method directly are highly unrecommended and might
not work anymore with the next version of the plugin. Using this hook, the sitemap plugin will
take care of everything like loading the required classes and so on.

Sample:

do_action("sm_rebuild");

The sitemap might not be rebuild immediately, since newer versions use a background WP-Cron
job by default to prevent that the user has to wait and avoid multiple rebuilds within a very short time.
In case the sitemap plugin is not installed, nothing will happen and no errors will be thrown.

===============================================

Adding additional PriorityProviders

This plugin uses several classes to calculate the post priority.
You can register your own provider and choose it at the options screen.

Your class has to extend the GoogleSitemapGeneratorPrioProviderBase class
which has a default constructor and a method called GetPostPriority
which you can override.

Look at the GoogleSitemapGeneratorPrioByPopularityContestProvider class
for an example.

To register your provider to the sitemap generator, use the following filter:

add_filter("sm_add_prio_provider","AddMyProvider");

Your function could look like this:

function AddMyProvider($providers) {
	array_push($providers,"MyProviderClass");
	return $providers;
}

Note that you have to return the modified list!
