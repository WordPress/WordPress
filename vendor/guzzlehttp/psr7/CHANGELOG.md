Several other fixes and improvements.


## [1.4.2] - 2017-03-20

### Fixed

- Reverted BC break to `Uri::resolve` and `Uri::removeDotSegments` by removing
  calls to `trigger_error` when deprecated methods are invoked.


## [1.4.1] - 2017-02-27

### Added

- Rriggering of silenced deprecation warnings.

### Fixed

- Reverted BC break by reintroducing behavior to automagically fix a URI with a
  relative path and an authority by adding a leading slash to the path. It's only
  deprecated now.


## [1.4.0] - 2017-02-21

### Added

- Added common URI utility methods based on RFC 3986 (see documentation in the readme):
  - `Uri::isDefaultPort`
  - `Uri::isAbsolute`
  - `Uri::isNetworkPathReference`
  - `Uri::isAbsolutePathReference`
  - `Uri::isRelativePathReference`
  - `Uri::isSameDocumentReference`
  - `Uri::composeComponents`
  - `UriNormalizer::normalize`
  - `UriNormalizer::isEquivalent`
  - `UriResolver::relativize`

### Changed

- Ensure `ServerRequest::getUriFromGlobals` returns a URI in absolute form.
- Allow `parse_response` to parse a response without delimiting space and reason.
- Ensure each URI modification results in a valid URI according to PSR-7 discussions.
  Invalid modifications will throw an exception instead of returning a wrong URI or
  doing some magic.
  - `(new Uri)->withPath('foo')->withHost('example.com')` will throw an exception
    because the path of a URI with an authority must start with a slash "/" or be empty
  - `(new Uri())->withScheme('http')` will return `'http://localhost'`

### Deprecated

- `Uri::resolve` in favor of `UriResolver::resolve`
- `Uri::removeDotSegments` in favor of `UriResolver::removeDotSegments`

### Fixed

- `Stream::read` when length parameter <= 0.
- `copy_to_stream` reads bytes in chunks instead of `maxLen` into memory.
- `ServerRequest::getUriFromGlobals` when `Host` header contains port.
- Compatibility of URIs with `file` scheme and empty host.


## [1.3.1] - 2016-06-25

### Fixed

- `Uri::__toString` for network path references, e.g. `//example.org`.
- Missing lowercase normalization for host.
- Handling of URI components in case they are `'0'` in a lot of places,
  e.g. as a user info password.
- `Uri::withAddedHeader` to correctly merge headers with different case.
- Trimming of header values in `Uri::withAddedHeader`. Header values may
  be surrounded by whitespace which should be ignored according to RFC 7230
  Section 3.2.4. This does not apply to header names.
- `Uri::withAddedHeader` with an array of header values.
- `Uri::resolve` when base path has no slash and handling of fragment.
- Handling of encoding in `Uri::with(out)QueryValue` so one can pass the
  key/value both in encoded as well as decoded form to those methods. This is
  consistent with withPath, withQuery etc.
- `ServerRequest::withoutAttribute` when attribute value is null.


## [1.3.0] - 2016-04-13

### Added

- Remaining interfaces needed for full PSR7 compatibility
  (ServerRequestInterface, UploadedFileInterface, etc.).
- Support for stream_for from scalars.

### Changed

- Can now extend Uri.

### Fixed
- A bug in validating request methods by making it more permissive.


## [1.2.3] - 2016-02-18

### Fixed

- Support in `GuzzleHttp\Psr7\CachingStream` for seeking forward on remote
  streams, which can sometimes return fewer bytes than requested with `fread`.
- Handling of gzipped responses with FNAME headers.


## [1.2.2] - 2016-01-22

### Added

- Support for URIs without any authority.
- Support for HTTP 451 'Unavailable For Legal Reasons.'
- Support for using '0' as a filename.
- Support for including non-standard ports in Host headers.


## [1.2.1] - 2015-11-02

### Changes

- Now supporting negative offsets when seeking to SEEK_END.


## [1.2.0] - 2015-08-15

### Changed

- Body as `"0"` is now properly added to a response.
- Now allowing forward seeking in CachingStream.
- Now properly parsing HTTP requests that contain proxy targets in
  `parse_request`.
- functions.php is now conditionally required.
- user-info is no longer dropped when resolving URIs.


## [1.1.0] - 2015-06-24

### Changed

- URIs can now be relative.
- `multipart/form-data` headers are now overridden case-insensitively.
- URI paths no longer encode the following characters because they are allowed
  in URIs: "(", ")", "*", "!", "'"
- A port is no longer added to a URI when the scheme is missing and no port is
  present.
