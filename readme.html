<p style="text-align: center"> Semantic Personal Publishing Platform </p>
<h1>First Things First</h1>
<p>Welcome. WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I'm proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we're dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>
<p style="text-align: right;">&#8212; Matt Mullenweg </p>

<h1 id="installation">Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory</li>
	<li>Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details</li>
	<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> </li>
	<li>Upload everything.</li>
	<li>Launch <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">/wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. This should setup the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <span class="file">wp-config.php</span> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather. </li>
	<li><strong>Note the password given to you.</strong></li>
	<li> The install script should then send you to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username <code>admin</code> and the password generated during the installation. You can then click on 'Profile' to change the password.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Upgrading</h1>
<p>Before you upgrade anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.</p>
<h2>Upgrading from any previous WordPress to 1.5:</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Delete your old WP files, saving ones you've modified </li>
	<li>Upload the new files</li>
	<li>Point your browser to <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/upgrade.php">/wp-admin/upgrade.php</a></span></li>
	<li>You wanted more, perhaps? That's it!</li>
</ol>
<h2>Template Changes</h2>
<p>If you have customized your templates you will probably have to make some changes to them. If you're converting your 1.2 or earlier templates, <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Upgrade_1.2_to_1.5">we've created a special guide for you</a>. </p>

<h1 id="requirements">System Recommendations</h1>
<ul>
	<li>PHP version <strong>4.1</strong> or higher</li>
	<li>MySQL version <strong>3.23.23</strong> or higher</li>
	<li>... and a link to <a href="http://wordpress.org">http://wordpress.org</a> on your site.</li>

<p>WordPress is the official continuation of <a href="http://cafelog.com/">b2/caf&eacute;log</a>, which came from Michel V. The work has been continued by the <a href="http://wordpress.org/about/">WordPress developers</a>. If you would like to support WordPress, please consider <a href="http://wordpress.org/donate/">donating</a>. </p>

<h1>Upgrading from another system</h1>
<p>WordPress can <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Importing_from_other_blogging_software">import from a number of systems</a>. First you need to get WordPress installed and working as described above.</p>

<h1 id="templates">XML-RPC Interface</h1>
<p>You can now post to your WordPress blog with tools like <a href="http://ecto.kung-foo.tv/">Ecto</a>, <a href="http://blogbuddy.sourceforge.net">BlogBuddy</a>, <a href="http://bloggar.com/">Bloggar</a>, <a href="http://www.ubique.ch/wapblogger/">WapBlogger</a> (post from your Wap cellphone!), <a href="http://radio.userland.com">Radio Userland</a> (which means you can use Radio's email-to-blog feature), <a href="http://www.zempt.com/">Zempt</a>, <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">NewzCrawler</a>, and other tools that support the Blogging APIs! :) You can read more about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support">XML-RPC support on the Codex</a>.</p>

<h1>Post via Email</h1>
<p>You can post from an email client! To set this up go to your &quot;Writing&quot; options screen and fill in the connection details for your secret POP3 account. Then you need to set up <code>wp-mail.php</code> to execute periodically to check the mailbox for new posts. You can do it with Cron-jobs, or if your host doesn't support it you can look into the various website-monitoring services, and make them check your <code>wp-mail.php</code> URL. </p>
<p> Posting is easy: Any email sent to the address you specify will be posted, with the subject as the title. It is best to keep the address dicrete. The script will <i>delete</i> emails that are successfully posted. </p>
<h1 id="notes">User Levels </h1>
<p>You may allow or disallow user registration in your <a href="wp-admin/options-general.php">General options</a>. If &quot;new users can blog&quot; is disabled you must first raise the level of a newly registered user to allow them to post. Click the plus sign next to their name on the <a href="wp-admin/users.php">Users</a> page. </p>
<h2>User Levels</h2>
<ul>
	<li>0 - New User </li>
	<li>1 - User can post, edit, and delete their own posts.</li>
	<li>5+ - Admin; can post, edit, delete other people's posts, and change the options.</li>
	<li>Any user whose level is higher than 1, can edit and delete the posts and change the level of lower users. Example: a level 2 user is not an admin, but can edit the posts of level 1 users, and up the level of a new user from 0 to 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually you want to have a team of level 1 users except for you.</p>
<h1> Final notes</h1>
<ul>
	<li>If you have any suggestions, ideas, comments, or if you (gasp!) found a bug, join us in the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/">Support Forums</a></li>
	<li>WordPress now has a robust plugin API that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API">plugin documentation in the Codex</a>. In most all cases you shouldn't modify any of the core code.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Share the Love</h1>
<p>WordPress has no multi-million dollar marketing campaign or celebrity sponsors, but we do have something even better&#8212;you. If you enjoy WordPress please consider telling a friend, setting it up for someone less knowledgable than yourself, or writing the author of a media article that overlooks us.</p>
