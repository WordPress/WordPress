<h1>First Things First</h1>
<p>Welcome. WordPress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I'm proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into WordPress, and we're dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>

<h1>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>wp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.
		<ol>
			<li>If for some reason this doesn't work, don't worry. It doesn't work on all web hosts. Open up <code>wp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>
			<li>Save the file as <code>wp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
			<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/install.php">wp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <code>wp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/" title="WordPress support">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.</li>
	<li>The installer should then send you to the <a href="wp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on 'Profile' to change the password.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Upgrading</h1>
<h2>Using the Automatic Upgrader</h2>
<p>If you are upgrading from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic upgrader:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open the <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/update-core.php">wp-admin/update-core.php</a></span> in your browser and follow the instructions.</li>
	<li>You wanted more, perhaps? That's it!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Upgrading Manually</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Before you upgrade anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.</li>
	<li>Delete your old WordPress files, saving ones you've modified.</li>
	<li>Upload the new files.</li>
	<li>Point your browser to <span class="file"><a href="wp-admin/upgrade.php">/wp-admin/upgrade.php</a>.</span></li>
</ol>

<h2>Theme Template Changes</h2>
<p>If you have customized your theme templates, you may have to make some changes across major versions.</p>

<h1>Migrating from other systems</h1>

	<li><a href="http://php.net/">PHP</a> version <strong>4.3</strong> or higher.</li>
	<li><a href="http://www.mysql.com/">MySQL</a> version <strong>4.1.2</strong> or higher.</li>
</ul>

<h1><abbr title="eXtensible Markup Language">XML</abbr>-<abbr title="Remote Procedure Call">RPC</abbr> and Atom Interface</h1>
<p>You can post to your WordPress blog with tools like <a href="http://download.live.com/writer">Windows Live Writer</a>, <a href="http://illuminex.com/ecto/">Ecto</a>, <a href="http://bloggar.com/">w.bloggar</a>, <a href="http://radio.userland.com/">Radio Userland</a> (which means you can use Radio's email-to-blog feature), <a href="http://www.newzcrawler.com/">NewzCrawler</a>, and other tools that support the blogging <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr>s! :) You can read more about <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/XML-RPC_Support"><abbr>XML</abbr>-<abbr>RPC</abbr> support on the Codex</a>.</p>

<h1>Post via Email</h1>
<p>You can post from an email client! To set this up go to your &quot;Writing&quot; options screen and fill in the connection details for your secret <abbr title="Post Office Protocol version 3">POP3</abbr> account. Then you need to set up <code>wp-mail.php</code> to execute periodically to check the mailbox for new posts. You can do it with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cron">cron</a>-jobs, or if your host doesn't support it you can look into the various website-monitoring services, and make them check your <code>wp-mail.php</code> <abbr title="Uniform Resource Locator">URL</abbr>.</p>
<p>Posting is easy: Any email sent to the address you specify will be posted, with the subject as the title. It is best to keep the address discrete. The script will <em>delete</em> emails that are successfully posted.</p>

<h1>User Roles</h1>
<p>We introduced a very flexible roles system in version 2.0. You can <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Roles_and_Capabilities" title="WordPress roles and capabilities">read more about Roles and Capabilities on the Codex</a>.</p>

<h1>Final Notes</h1>
<ul>

	<li>WordPress has a robust plugin <abbr title="application programming interface">API</abbr> that makes extending the code easy. If you are a developer interested in utilizing this, see the <a href="http://codex.wordpress.org/Plugin_API" title="WordPress plugin API">plugin documentation in the Codex</a>. You shouldn't modify any of the core code.</li>
</ul>

<h1>Share the Love</h1>
<p>WordPress has no multi-million dollar marketing campaign or celebrity sponsors, but we do have something even better&#8212;you. If you enjoy WordPress please consider telling a friend, setting it up for someone less knowledgable than yourself, or writing the author of a media article that overlooks us.</p>
